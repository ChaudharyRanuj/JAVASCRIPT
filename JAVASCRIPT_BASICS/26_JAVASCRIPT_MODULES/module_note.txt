Q1. What is module?

Javascript ES6 provides a provision of importing and exporting of module directly
which can be reused when required, unlike older version.

Note: Module means dividing you code into various logical pieces & importing them when required.

Q2. Can you Import any module inside the script tag?

type attribute value module makes script tag import module
           v
           v
<script type="module">
      import { calc } from "./calc.js";
      calc();
</script>


Q3. How will you run the import and export statement in local machine?

When using import and export statement in local machine we need a server
for running the import and export statements.

Note: 
1). For Frameworks like REACT, ANGULAR we have webpack or related build tool which run the development server, so import and export statements are execute directly.
2) With simple HTML and Javascript we need to have local server or we can configure
the chrome web server.
