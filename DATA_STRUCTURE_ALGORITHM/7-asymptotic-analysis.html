    <h1>Asymptotic Analysis and Notation</h1>
    <h2>What is Asymptotic Analysis?</h2>
    <p>
      As we know that data structure is a way of organizing the data efficiently
      and that efficiency is measured either in terms of time or space. So, the
      ideal data structure is a structure that occupies the least possible time
      to perform all its operation and the memory space. Our focus would be on
      finding the time complexity rather than space complexity, and by finding
      the time complexity, we can decide which data structure is the best for an
      algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main question arises in our mind that on what basis should we compare
      the time complexity of data structures?. The time complexity can be
      compared based on operations performed on them. Let's consider a simple
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we have an array of 100 elements, and we want to insert a new
      element at the beginning of the array. This becomes a very tedious task as
      we first need to shift the elements towards the right, and we will add new
      element at the starting of the array.
    </p>
    <p> Suppose we consider the linked list as a data structure to add the element
      at the beginning. The linked list contains two parts, i.e., data and address
      of the next node. We simply add the address of the first node in the new
      node, and head pointer will now point to the newly added node. Therefore, we
      conclude that adding the data at the beginning of the linked list is faster
      than the arrays. In this way, we can compare the data structures and select
      the best possible data structure for performing the operations. Pause Next

      How to find the Time Complexity or running time for performing the
      operations? The measuring of the actual running time is not practical at
      all. The running time to perform any operation depends on the size of the
      input. Let's understand this statement through a simple example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we have an array of five elements, and we want to add a new
      element at the beginning of the array. To achieve this, we need to shift
      each element towards right, and suppose each element takes one unit of
      time. There are five elements, so five units of time would be taken.
      Suppose there are 1000 elements in an array, then it takes 1000 units of
      time to shift. It concludes that time complexity depends upon the input
      size.
