    <h1>Algorithm Complexity</h1>
    <h2>What is algorithm?</h2>
    <p>Steps to do any task through computer code is known as algorithm.</p>
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>
      The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps
      to finish the execution.
    </p>
    <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Amount of space required to solve a problem</li>
      <li>Space complexity = Auxiliary Space+ Input Size</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Big O Notation</h2>
    <p>Use to denote both time and space complexity.</p>
